# Reportobello Plain JavaScript Demo

This is an example of using the Reportobello API with plain JavaScript.
This is does not show off all the features of Reportobello, but the important ones you will use most often.

## Setup

First, install NPM dependencies:

```
$ npm i
```

Then, start a static HTTP server in the current directory. Some examples web servers are:

* [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (Node.js): `npx http-server -p 8000`

* [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html#module-http.server): `python3 -m http.server`

Navigate to `localhost:8080` (or whatever port you choose).

Next, put in your Reportobello API key, and if you are using a self-hosted instance of Reportobello, set the host.
